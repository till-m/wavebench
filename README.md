# WaveBench: Benchmark Datasets for Wave-based Imaging Problems

This repository contains a benchmark dataset for evaluating the effectiveness of machine-learning-based methods for wave imaging problems. The benchmark dataset includes two variants of wave datasets, one is time-varying (based on the Wave Equation), and the other is time-harmonic (based on the Helmholtz Equation).
